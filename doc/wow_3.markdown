The way to combine different midi tracks is by using `(+:+)` and `=:=`. Yes, just like the way we combine Music.T.

from Example.NewResolutions

	part1 = MidiMusic.fromStdMelody marimba (loudness1 0.7 pattern)
	        +:+
	        MidiMusic.fromStdMelody xylo    (loudness1 1.2 melody1)
	    =:= MidiMusic.fromStdMelody marimba (loudness1 0.7 (Music.replicate 4 pattern))
	
By the way, I encourage you to listen to the midi file generated by this example ( inside haskore/Test/MIDI/NewResolutions.midi ), it really shows the power of Haskore / Haskell, and it actually sound nice ( which aren't all true for computer generated musics ).

The reason this works is that we raise Music.T to MIDI.T by `fromMelodyNullAttr` or `fromStdMelody` and

in Music.GeneralMIDI

	import qualified Haskore.Music.Rhythmic  as RhyMusic
	
	type T        = RhyMusic.T        Drum Instr
    
	fromStdMelody :: Instr -> StdMelody.T -> T
	fromStdMelody = RhyMusic.fromStdMelody
    
	fromMelodyNullAttr :: Instr -> Melody.T () -> T
	fromMelodyNullAttr = RhyMusic.fromMelodyNullAttr
	
and in Music.Rhythmic

	type T drum instr = Music.T (Note drum instr)

See? Midi.T transforms back to (seriously need a better word ...) Music.T. This is even better then duck typing.
